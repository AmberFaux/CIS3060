        <h2>Mental Health Matters</h2>
        <p>Social issues such as homelessness, poverty, food hunger, and lack of educational opportunties often ostracize students from their local community, affecting their mental health as they feel alone and stressed.By providing them with enriching opportunities to understand their emotions and psychology at a young age, the students would be better equipped to overcome future challenges in life. </p>
